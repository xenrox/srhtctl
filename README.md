srhtctl is a CLI for interacting with the sourcehut API.

A goal of this project is that you can use sourcehut from your terminal just like you would from your browser.

## Installation

Just download the source code and build it with `make`.

There is an [aur package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/srhtctl/) for Arch Linux.

## Usage

You have to create a `config.ini` in your `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` under the srhtctl folder.
On Darwin, your configuration directory is `~/Library/Application Support/srhtctl`.
The only necessary value is your sourcehut authentication token.
By default you will interact with the original sourcehut instance at https://sr.ht/.

Currently implemented are parts of the meta, git, paste and builds api.
You can for example create pastes or deploy build manifests from your command line.
As extra features you can create pastes with expiration times and edit build files on the fly with your favourite `$EDITOR`.

## Wiki

There will be documentation in the [wiki](https://man.xenrox.net/~xenrox/srhtctl/).
The wiki is based on the `wiki` branch of this repository.

## Contributing

You can send patches to the [mailing list] and report bugs via email on the [tracker].

## Comments

There is a systemd service example in `assets` for cleaning up your expired pastes.
